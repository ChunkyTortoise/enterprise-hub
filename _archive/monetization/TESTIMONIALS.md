## Featured Testimonials

### Margin Hunter - Cost-Volume-Profit Analysis

#### Sarah J. - SaaS Founder, Series A Startup
> "Margin Hunter helped me model our pricing strategy for our Series A pitch. I was able to show investors exactly what our break-even point would be at different price tiers and volume assumptions. The sensitivity heatmap made it crystal clear how much margin we had to play with during negotiations. We raised $5M, and this tool was in the appendix of our pitch deck."

**Use Case**: Series A fundraising, pricing strategy
**Impact**: Used in successful $5M funding round
**Module**: Margin Hunter
**Time Saved**: 8 hours of Excel modeling

#### Marcus T. - E-Commerce Operator, D2C Brand
> "Our supplier increased prices by 18% overnight. I used Margin Hunter to model whether we should: (A) absorb the cost, (B) raise prices, or (C) discontinue the product. The sensitivity heatmap showed that a $3 price increase would maintain our margin while keeping us below break-even. We raised prices, kept the product, and maintained profitability. This tool saved us from a $50k annual loss."

**Use Case**: Supplier price increase, profitability analysis
**Impact**: Avoided $50k annual loss
**Module**: Margin Hunter

### Content Engine - AI-Powered LinkedIn Posts

#### Alex P. - Sales Leader, B2B SaaS
> "I know I should post on LinkedIn 3x per week, but writing content takes forever. Content Engine changed the game. I batch-generate 12 posts on Sunday in 30 minutes, schedule them in Buffer, and focus on actually selling. My profile views increased 3x, and I've generated 5 inbound demos in the past month—directly attributed to consistent LinkedIn presence."

**Use Case**: LinkedIn content creation for lead generation
**Impact**: 3x profile views, 5 inbound demos/month
**Module**: Content Engine

#### Jessica R. - Marketing Agency Owner
> "We manage LinkedIn for 15 B2B clients. Before Content Engine, we had 2 full-time writers cranking out 60 posts/month at $120k/year in salary. Now, AI generates first drafts in 2 minutes, writers polish them in 15 minutes, and we've cut content production time by 67%. We reinvested the savings into hiring a video editor. Game changer."

**Use Case**: Agency client content production
**Impact**: 67% reduction in content production time, $80k/year cost savings
**Module**: Content Engine
