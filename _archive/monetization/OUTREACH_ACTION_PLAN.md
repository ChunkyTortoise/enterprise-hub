## Talking Points for Cold Outreach

### Email/LinkedIn DM Template

**Subject:** Built 7 production data tools - [SPECIFIC SKILL/PROBLEM]

```
Hi [NAME],

I came across [COMPANY] while researching companies using [TECHNOLOGY/SOLVING PROBLEM].

I recently built EnterpriseHub - a 7-module business intelligence platform with:
- Marketing analytics (campaign ROI, A/B testing, attribution modeling)
- Automated data profiling (AI-powered insights from CSVs)
- Financial modeling (CVP analysis, scenario planning)
- Technical analysis (stock charts, indicators)

All production-grade: 220+ tests, CI/CD pipeline, live on Streamlit Cloud.

I noticed [COMPANY] is [SPECIFIC OBSERVATION - hiring for data role, building analytics product, mentioned analytics challenges in recent post].

I'd love to share some patterns I learned about [SPECIFIC TECHNICAL CHALLENGE - e.g., "handling large datasets in Streamlit" or "cost-optimizing Claude API integrations"].

Open to a quick 15-min call if you're interested. No sales pitch - just sharing knowledge.

Live demo: https://enterprise-app-mwrxqf7cccewnomrbhjttf.streamlit.app/

Best,
