### Template 2A: LLM/AI Integration Project

```
Hi [CLIENT_NAME],

I've integrated Claude API into 3 production modules with retry logic, cost optimization, and graceful degradation.

Most demos show the happy path. Production is about handling the unhappy paths:
❌ Rate limits (429 errors)
❌ Network timeouts (30+ second waits)
❌ Invalid API keys (user misconfiguration)
❌ Cost overruns (unchecked token usage)

🤖 My Production AI Implementations:

1. Content Engine - AI-Powered Content Generation
   - Generates LinkedIn posts in 3 tones (professional, casual, technical)
   - Topic validation before API call (saves costs on bad inputs)
   - Cost estimate shown upfront (~$0.003 per post)
   - Response caching in session state (prevents duplicate charges)

2. Data Detective - AI Data Insights
   - Analyzes CSV uploads, generates actionable recommendations
   - Handles files up to 500MB (chunking for large datasets)
   - Structured prompts for consistent output format
   - Timeout handling (30s limit with graceful failure)

3. Agent Logic - Multi-Agent Workflows
   - Sentiment analysis on text data
   - Parallel processing of multiple text inputs
   - Confidence scoring for predictions

🔗 Live Examples: https://enterprise-app-mwrxqf7cccewnomrbhjttf.streamlit.app/

**My Approach for Your Project:**

Based on your requirements for [RESTATE_THEIR_AI_NEED], here's how I'll implement it:

1. Architecture Design: [SPECIFIC_DETAIL about LLM choice, prompt engineering strategy]
   Example: "I'll use Claude 3.5 Sonnet for [TASK] because of its [REASON - cost, accuracy, speed]. Estimated cost: $[X] per 1000 requests."

2. Production Safeguards:
   ✅ Exponential backoff retry for rate limits (3 attempts: 1s → 2s → 4s)
   ✅ Input validation (prevents wasted API calls on invalid data)
   ✅ Cost monitoring (max token limits, request logging)
   ✅ Graceful degradation (app works without API if key missing)
   ✅ Session-based API keys (security by default, no hardcoded credentials)

3. Integration: [SPECIFIC_DETAIL about how AI fits into their existing system]
   Example: "I'll create a REST API endpoint that your React frontend can call, with response caching in Redis."

4. Testing & Validation: [SPECIFIC_DETAIL about accuracy measurement]
   Example: "I'll use a labeled test set of 500 examples to measure accuracy, with A/B testing against your current solution."

**Tech Stack:**
- Anthropic Claude API (or OpenAI GPT if preferred)
- Python 3.11 (asyncio for parallel processing)
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- pytest (AI output validation tests)
- Prompt versioning (track performance across iterations)

**What You'll Get:**
✅ Production-ready AI integration (not a prototype)
✅ Error handling for all failure modes
✅ Cost optimization (caching, prompt engineering)
✅ Monitoring dashboard (API usage, costs, latency)
✅ Complete documentation (prompts, architecture, API limits)
✅ 2-week support post-delivery

**Timeline:** [TIMEFRAME - typically 1-2 weeks for API integrations, 3-4 weeks for complex multi-agent systems]

**Pricing:**
[X hours] at $[YOUR_RATE]/hour = $[TOTAL]
(Does not include API costs - Claude API charges ~$0.003-0.015 per request depending on model and tokens)

**Questions:**
1. Which LLM are you leaning toward? (Claude, GPT-4, open-source like LLaMA)
2. What's your expected request volume? (helps estimate costs and design caching strategy)
3. Do you have accuracy/latency requirements? (e.g., 95% accuracy, <2s response time)

I've handled API rate limits, cost overruns, and timeout errors in production - I'll make sure your implementation is bulletproof.

Looking forward to building reliable AI into your product.

Best,
Cayman

P.S. All my AI modules include retry logic and cost monitoring by default. You can see it working in the live demo.

### Template 2B: Workflow Automation Project

**Use When Job Description Mentions:** "automate manual process", "Python automation", "task automation"

```
Hi [CLIENT_NAME],

I automated workflows that were taking hours - now they take minutes.

EnterpriseHub includes several automation examples:
- Data profiling that replaces 2-hour manual EDA sessions (Data Detective)
- Campaign ROI calculations that replace spreadsheet formulas (Marketing Analytics)
- Multi-scenario financial modeling (Margin Hunter evaluates 100 scenarios instantly)

🔗 See Automation in Action: https://enterprise-app-mwrxqf7cccewnomrbhjttf.streamlit.app/

**For Your Project:**

You mentioned needing to automate [SPECIFIC_TASK from job description]. Here's my implementation plan:

1. Process Mapping: [SPECIFIC_DETAIL about current manual workflow]
   Example: "Currently you're copying data from Salesforce → Excel → Manually calculating metrics → Sending email reports. I'll automate all 4 steps."

2. Automation Design: [SPECIFIC_DETAIL about technical approach]
   Example: "I'll use Salesforce API to fetch data hourly, pandas to calculate metrics, and SendGrid API to email formatted reports to stakeholders."

3. Error Handling: [SPECIFIC_DETAIL about failure scenarios]
   Example: "If Salesforce API is down, system will retry 3 times then send admin alert. No silent failures."

4. Scheduling: [SPECIFIC_DETAIL about when automation runs]
   Example: "Runs every Monday at 8 AM EST, with manual trigger option available in web UI."

**Tech Stack:**
- Python 3.11 (automation scripts)
- APScheduler or Airflow (workflow orchestration)
- Streamlit (admin dashboard to monitor/trigger jobs)
- Logging (track every run, errors, performance)

**Deliverables:**
✅ Automated workflow (replaces manual process)
✅ Admin dashboard (monitor runs, view logs, manual triggers)
✅ Error notifications (email/Slack alerts on failures)
✅ Documentation (setup guide, troubleshooting)
✅ Source code with tests

**Timeline:** [TIMEFRAME - typically 1-2 weeks for workflow automation]

**ROI Estimate:**
If this currently takes [X hours/week] at $[hourly cost], you'll save $[Y/year] in labor costs.
Project pays for itself in [Z weeks/months].

**Questions:**
1. What triggers this workflow? (time-based, event-based, manual)
2. Where does the data currently live? (specific systems, file formats)
3. Who needs to be notified when it runs? (stakeholders for reports/alerts)

I build automation that actually works in production - with error handling, logging, and monitoring built in.

Looking forward to freeing up your team's time.

Best,
Cayman
