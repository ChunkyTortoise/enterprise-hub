## Marketing Niche

### 1. Marketing Dashboard Development
**Use for:** "campaign tracking", "marketing analytics"
**Attach:** `marketing-analytics-dashboard.png`

```
Hi [CLIENT_NAME],

I built exactly what you're describing - it's live right now.

I created Marketing Analytics Hub, a 6-tab campaign tracking platform with:
- Campaign Dashboard (Spend, Revenue, ROI)
- ROI Calculator (Scenario modeling with heatmaps)
- A/B Testing Module (Statistical significance calculator)
- Attribution Modeling (5 models side-by-side)

See the live demo: https://enterprise-app-mwrxqf7cccewnomrbhjttf.streamlit.app/ (Select "Marketing Analytics")

**My Approach for Your Project:**
[SPECIFIC_DETAIL about their requirements]

I'll build this using Python + Streamlit + Plotly.

**Timeline:** [TIMEFRAME] for first working version.

All code includes automated tests (85% coverage) and comprehensive documentation.

Best,
Cayman

### 2. Campaign ROI Tracking Tool
**Use for:** "ROI calculation", "profit tracking"
**Attach:** `marketing-analytics-roi-heatmap.png`

```
Hi [CLIENT_NAME],

ROI tracking shouldn't take 2 hours per campaign. I automated it.

I built a Marketing Analytics platform with a dedicated ROI Calculator module that instantly calculates ROI, ROAS, and CPA. It includes a scenario modeling heatmap to test 100 profit scenarios simultaneously.

See it live: https://enterprise-app-mwrxqf7cccewnomrbhjttf.streamlit.app/ (Select "Marketing Analytics" → "ROI Calculator")

**For Your Project:**
[SPECIFIC_DETAIL about their data sources]

I can customize this to pull data from your platforms automatically.

**Timeline:** [TIMEFRAME].

### 3. A/B Testing Significance Calculator
**Use for:** "A/B test tools", "split testing"
**Attach:** `marketing-analytics-ab-test.png`

```
Hi [CLIENT_NAME],

Stop guessing. Start knowing with 95% confidence.

I built an A/B testing calculator that uses industry-standard statistical methods (Z-test, Chi-square). It identifies winners with confidence intervals and sample size recommendations.

See it live: https://enterprise-app-mwrxqf7cccewnomrbhjttf.streamlit.app/ (Select "Marketing Analytics" → "A/B Testing")

**For Your Project:**
[SPECIFIC_DETAIL about their testing scenarios]

I can integrate this into your existing dashboard or build a standalone tool.

## BI & Data Niche

### 4. Data Analysis Dashboard
**Use for:** "data profiling", "EDA tools"
**Attach:** `data-detective-ai.png`

```
Hi [CLIENT_NAME],

What if your data analysis took 2 minutes instead of 2 hours?

I built **Data Detective** - an AI-powered EDA platform. Upload a CSV and instantly get:
- Data Profiling (missing values, types)
- Column Analysis (histograms, outliers)
- Correlation Matrix (heatmaps)
- AI Insights (Claude 3.5 Sonnet analysis)

See it live: https://enterprise-app-mwrxqf7cccewnomrbhjttf.streamlit.app/ (Select "Data Detective")

**For Your Project:**
[SPECIFIC_DETAIL about their data]

I can customize this to handle your specific schema and metrics.

**Timeline:** [TIMEFRAME].

### 5. Financial Modeling Tool (CVP Analysis)
**Use for:** "financial dashboards", "pricing tools"
**Attach:** `margin-hunter-heatmap.png`

```
Hi [CLIENT_NAME],

I built Excel-quality CVP analysis in a modern web interface.

**Margin Hunter** calculates Break-Even Point, Contribution Margin, and Margin of Safety. It features an interactive sensitivity heatmap to test 100 pricing scenarios at once.

See it live: https://enterprise-app-mwrxqf7cccewnomrbhjttf.streamlit.app/ (Select "Margin Hunter")

**For Your Project:**
[SPECIFIC_DETAIL about their products]

I can customize this for multi-product analysis or time-series modeling.

**Use for:** "AI integration", "LLM implementation"
**Attach:** `content-engine-output.png`

Hi [CLIENT_NAME],

I've integrated Claude API into 3 production modules with retry logic and cost optimization.

**My Experience:**
- Content Engine: Generates LinkedIn posts ($0.003/post)
- Data Detective: AI insights from CSVs
- Agent Logic: Sentiment analysis

I implement graceful degradation, exponential backoff retries, and session-based API key management.

See examples: https://enterprise-app-mwrxqf7cccewnomrbhjttf.streamlit.app/
