## 📨 TEMPLATE 1: For SaaS Founders (Pricing/Analytics Pain)

**When to use:** They posted about pricing, metrics, or analytics

**Subject:** (Connection request)

**Message:**
```
Hi [First Name],

Saw your post about [specific topic they posted about - pricing/analytics/dashboards]. I built a 7-module analytics platform that handles exactly this kind of problem.

Live demo: https://enterprise-app-mwrxqf7cccewnomrbhjttf.streamlit.app/

Modules include break-even analysis, margin optimization, and AI-powered insights. Built with production-grade testing (301 tests, 85% coverage).

Would a custom version for [their company] be useful? Happy to show you a quick walkthrough.

Best,
Cayman
```

**Why it works:**
- References their content (shows you're not spamming)
- Leads with demo link (they can verify quality immediately)
- Specific outcome (custom version for their company)
- Low-friction CTA (just a walkthrough)

## 📨 TEMPLATE 2: For Fintech/Finance Startups

**When to use:** Companies building financial products or managing financial data

**Subject:** (Connection request)

**Message:**
```
Hi [First Name],

I built an alternative to Bloomberg Terminal for [use case - startups/analysts/teams] - includes real-time market data, technical indicators, and AI-powered financial analysis.

👉 Try it: https://enterprise-app-mwrxqf7cccewnomrbhjttf.streamlit.app/

I'm taking on 2-3 custom dashboard projects this month ($500-1.5K range). If [their company] needs financial analytics, pricing models, or custom reporting, I'd love to chat.

Available for a quick call this week?

Cayman
```

**Why it works:**
- Strong hook (Bloomberg alternative = immediate credibility)
- Clear pricing (filters out tire-kickers)
- Scarcity (2-3 projects this month)
- Direct CTA (call this week)

## 📨 TEMPLATE 3: For Marketing Agencies

**When to use:** Agencies that need client reporting or analytics dashboards

**Subject:** (Connection request)

**Message:**
```
Hey [First Name],

Quick question - does [Agency Name] build custom analytics dashboards for clients?

I just finished a multi-module platform (live demo: https://enterprise-app-mwrxqf7cccewnomrbhjttf.streamlit.app/) and I'm looking for 1-2 agencies to partner with on white-label dashboard projects.

My rate: $500-1.5K per dashboard (1 week turnaround). You mark it up however you like.

Worth a 15-min call to explore?

Best,
Cayman
```

**Why it works:**
- Opens with a question (higher response rate)
- Partnership angle (not just selling)
- Clear economics (they can resell your work)
- Fast turnaround (agencies love speed)

## 📨 TEMPLATE 4: For Ecommerce Brands (Margin/Pricing Focus)

**When to use:** DTC brands, ecommerce companies struggling with margins or pricing

**Subject:** (Connection request)

**Message:**
```
Hi [First Name],

Noticed [Company Name] is in the [product category] space. Built a margin optimization tool that might be relevant.

Demo: https://enterprise-app-mwrxqf7cccewnomrbhjttf.streamlit.app/ (check out "Margin Hunter" module)

It calculates break-even points, optimal pricing, and scenario modeling in real-time. Could save your team 10+ hours/month vs spreadsheets.

Would a custom version for [Company Name] be interesting?

Cayman
```

**Why it works:**
- Specific module callout (Margin Hunter)
- Quantified benefit (save 10+ hours/month)
- Personalized to their industry
- Single yes/no question

**When to use:** CTOs, VPs of Engineering, or product leaders at tech companies

**Subject:** (Connection request)

**Message:**
```

If [Company Name] is exploring:
