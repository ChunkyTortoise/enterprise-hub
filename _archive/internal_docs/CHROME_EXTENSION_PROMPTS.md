## 🎯 VERIFICATION PROMPTS

### **After filling out each platform:**

**For Fiverr:**
```
I just filled out my Fiverr gig. Can you review what I entered and check:
1. Is the title under 80 characters?
2. Is the description well-formatted (bullets, line breaks)?
3. Are the 3 pricing tiers clearly differentiated?
4. Did I add all 5 tags?

[Then paste what you entered so extension can review]
```

**For Upwork:**
```
I just filled out my Upwork profile. Can you verify:
1. Title is under 100 chars and includes key terms (Python, Streamlit, $24K Tool)?
2. Overview starts with the curiosity hook ("I replicate $24K/year tools...")?
3. All 3 portfolio items have descriptions?
4. Hourly rate is set to $65?

[Then share what you entered]
```

## 🎯 TROUBLESHOOTING PROMPTS

### **If a field is too long:**
```
The [field name] is over the character limit.

Current text: [paste what you tried]

Reference file: [which .md file]

Can you trim this to fit [X] characters while keeping the most impactful parts?
```

### **If formatting is lost:**
```
When I pasted the description, all the bullet points disappeared.

The platform doesn't support markdown bullets (•).

Can you reformat the description to use:
- Plain dashes (-)
- Or numbered lists (1., 2., 3.)

Here's the original: [paste text]
```

### **If you can't find the right field:**
```
I'm on [Fiverr/Upwork/LinkedIn] but I can't find the [field name] field.

Can you:
1. Describe where it should be located
2. Give me alternative field names to look for
3. Take a screenshot if needed (I'll describe what I see)
```

**Not using extension, just need the info:**

## 💡 TIPS FOR USING EXTENSION

### **Best Practices:**
1. **Open the reference file** in a split screen so extension can see it
2. **Go field-by-field** - Don't rush through multiple fields at once
3. **Verify character counts** before pasting
4. **Ask for reformatting** if bullets/formatting breaks
5. **Take breaks** - Do 1 platform at a time (Fiverr first = fastest)

### **What Extension CAN'T Do:**
- Upload images (you'll manually upload from `docs/screenshots/`)
- Select from dropdowns (you'll manually select skills)
- Record video (you'll use phone camera)
- Submit forms (you'll click "Publish" yourself)

### **What Extension CAN Do:**
- Read your template files
- Copy text to paste
- Verify character counts
- Reformat if needed
- Guide you step-by-step
- Catch errors before you submit
