I build production-grade Python applications with enterprise testing standards.

WHAT I'VE BUILT:
EnterpriseHub - 8-module financial analytics platform (live demo: https://enterprise-app-mwrxqf7cccewnomrbhjttf.streamlit.app/)
• Market analysis tools (technical indicators, real-time data)
• AI-powered financial insights (Claude 3.5 Sonnet integration)
• Marketing analytics dashboards (campaign ROI, attribution modeling)
• Data profiling with automated EDA
• Financial modeling (CVP analysis, break-even calculations)

Production Quality Standards:
• 313 automated tests (pytest framework)
• 85% code coverage
• CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
• Live deployment on Streamlit Cloud
• WCAG AAA accessibility compliance

MY EXPERTISE:
✓ Streamlit dashboards (multi-page apps, session state, caching)
✓ Data visualization (Plotly, interactive charts, 4-panel layouts)
✓ Financial analytics (yfinance API, technical indicators, stock analysis)
✓ AI integration (Claude API, retry logic, cost optimization)
✓ Testing & QA (pytest, fixtures, mocks, 80%+ coverage standards)
✓ API development (REST, authentication, error handling)

WHAT I DELIVER:
→ Clean, documented code following PEP 8 standards
→ Automated tests for reliability (not optional)
→ User-friendly interfaces (no technical knowledge required)
→ Deployment support (Streamlit Cloud, AWS, or on-premise)
→ 2-week post-delivery support

I'm transitioning from enterprise development to freelance work. I bring corporate-grade reliability to every project.
