## ⚠️ COMMON PITFALLS (Avoid These)

### **1. Over-customizing Profiles**
❌ "Let me perfect this for 3 more hours"
✅ Ship good-enough profiles TODAY, iterate based on results

### **2. Bidding on Everything**
❌ Apply to 100 jobs at $10-50 budget
✅ Target 20 quality jobs at $500-2000 budget

### **3. Slow Response Times**
❌ "I'll reply tomorrow morning"
✅ Install mobile apps, respond within 2 hours

### **4. Underpricing**
❌ "I'll charge $30/hr to compete"
✅ Stick to $65/hr (filters bad clients, attracts quality)

### **5. No Follow-Up**
❌ Send proposals and wait passively
✅ Follow up after 3 days, adjust strategy after 20 proposals

---
