  - ROI Percentage: (Revenue - Spend) / Spend × 100
  - ROAS (Return on Ad Spend): Revenue / Spend
  - CPA (Cost Per Acquisition): Spend / Customers
  - Profit: Revenue - Spend

  - Optimize for target ROI

**Example Scenario:**
> With $5,000 spend and 1,000 visitors:
> - At 3% conversion + $400 AOV = **+140% ROI**
> - At 5% conversion + $300 AOV = **+200% ROI**
> - At 2% conversion + $200 AOV = **-20% ROI (loss)**

### 3. 👥 Customer Acquisition Metrics

**Understand customer economics** with CLV and CAC analysis:

#### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
- **Formula**: (Marketing Spend + Sales Costs) / New Customers
- **Inputs**: Marketing spend, sales costs, customers acquired
- **Output**: Cost to acquire one customer

#### Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
- **Formula**: (Avg Purchase × Purchase Frequency × Lifespan) × Profit Margin
- **Inputs**: Purchase value, frequency, lifespan, margin
- **Output**: Total profit per customer over lifetime

#### CLV:CAC Ratio
- **✅ Healthy**: ≥3:1 (sustainable growth)
- **⚠️ Acceptable**: 1-3:1 (room for improvement)
- **❌ Poor**: <1:1 (losing money on customers)

#### Cohort Retention Analysis
- **Visual heatmap** showing retention by cohort month
- **Identify** when customers churn (Month 1, 2, 3, etc.)
- **Optimize** retention strategies based on data

**Example:**
```
CAC: $50
CLV: $450
CLV:CAC Ratio: 9.0x ✅ Healthy - Sustainable growth!

Interpretation: You make $9 for every $1 spent acquiring customers
```

### 4. 🧪 Statistical Testing

**Stop guessing, start knowing** with statistical rigor:

#### A/B Test Significance Calculator

- **Inputs**:
  - Variant A: Visitors and conversions
  - Variant B: Visitors and conversions
- **Calculations**:
  - Conversion rates for both variants
  - Lift percentage (improvement or decline)
  - P-value (statistical significance)
  - Confidence level
- **Interpretation**:
  - Clear winner/loser/inconclusive verdict
  - Confidence percentage (e.g., 95% confident)
  - Sample size recommendations
- **Visual Comparison**:
  - Side-by-side bar chart
  - Green for winner, red for loser
  - Exact percentage differences

**Example Test:**
```
Variant A: 1,000 visitors → 50 conversions (5.0%)
Variant B: 1,000 visitors → 65 conversions (6.5%)

Result:
✅ Statistically Significant Winner!
- Lift: +30% (1.5 percentage points)
- P-value: 0.0234
- Confidence: 97.7%
- Verdict: Deploy Variant B
```

**Minimum Sample Size**: 30 visitors per variant (automatically validated)

#### Multi-Variant Testing (A/B/C/D/n)

**Test multiple variants simultaneously** like Google Ads:

- **Inputs**:
  - 3-10 variants with visitors and conversions each
  - Support for testing multiple ad creatives, landing pages, or email variants
- **Statistical Method**:
  - Chi-square test for independence across all variants
  - Determines if conversion rate differences are statistically significant
  - P-value interpretation with 95% confidence threshold
- **Visual Comparison**:
  - Multi-variant bar chart showing all conversion rates
  - Highlight best and worst performers
  - Clear statistical significance indicator

**Example Multi-Variant Test:**
```
Testing 4 Ad Creatives:
- Creative A: 1,000 visitors → 45 conversions (4.5%)
- Creative B: 1,000 visitors → 62 conversions (6.2%)
- Creative C: 1,000 visitors → 58 conversions (5.8%)
- Creative D: 1,000 visitors → 48 conversions (4.8%)

Result:
✅ Statistically Significant Difference!
- Best Performer: Creative B (6.2%)
- Improvement vs Worst: +37.8%
- Chi-square p-value: 0.018
- Confidence: 98.2%
- Verdict: Scale Creative B, pause Creative A
```

**Business Value**: Test multiple variants simultaneously like Google Ads campaign experiments, eliminating the need to run sequential A/B tests and reducing time-to-insight by 60-75%.

### 5. 🎯 Marketing Attribution Modeling

**Understand which touchpoints drive conversions** with 5 attribution models:

#### First-Touch Attribution
- **Logic**: 100% credit to first touchpoint
- **Use Case**: Measure top-of-funnel effectiveness
- **Example**: Social ad gets all credit for starting journey

#### Last-Touch Attribution
- **Logic**: 100% credit to last touchpoint before conversion
- **Use Case**: Measure bottom-of-funnel closers
- **Example**: Retargeting ad gets all credit for final conversion

#### Linear Attribution
- **Logic**: Equal credit across all touchpoints
- **Use Case**: Balanced view of full customer journey
- **Example**: 5 touchpoints = 20% credit each

#### Time-Decay Attribution
- **Logic**: More credit to recent touchpoints, less to earlier
- **Use Case**: Recency-weighted customer journey
- **Example**: Last touchpoint gets 2x credit of first

#### Position-Based Attribution (U-Shaped)
- **Logic**: 40% credit to first touchpoint, 40% to last, 20% split among middle touchpoints
- **Use Case**: Industry standard for e-commerce and SaaS - values both awareness and conversion
- **Example**: 5 touchpoints = First (40%), Middle 3 (6.67% each), Last (40%)
- **Distribution**: U-shaped curve emphasizing beginning and end of customer journey
- **Why It Matters**: Balances credit between top-of-funnel acquisition and bottom-of-funnel conversion, reflecting that both awareness and close matter equally

**Visual Output**:
- Bar chart showing conversion credit by channel
- Attribution breakdown table with percentages
- Model comparison for strategic decisions

**Example Journey:**
```
Customer Path: Social Ad → Website → Email → Retarget → Direct Purchase

Attribution Results:
- First-Touch: Social Media = 100%
- Last-Touch: Direct = 100%
- Linear: Each channel = 20%
- Time-Decay: Direct 40%, Retarget 30%, Email 18%, Website 8%, Social 4%
- Position-Based: Social 40%, Website 6.67%, Email 6.67%, Retarget 6.67%, Direct 40%
```

## FAQ

### Q: Do I need marketing data in a specific format?
**A**: For automated features, CSV with columns: campaign, channel, spend, revenue, conversions. For manual calculators, just input numbers directly.

### Q: How accurate are the A/B test calculations?
**A**: We use industry-standard two-proportion z-tests (same math as Optimizely, VWO). Results match statistical software like R or Python scipy.

### Q: What if I don't have CLV data yet?
**A**: Use industry benchmarks to estimate (e.g., e-commerce: 3-year lifespan, 4 purchases/year). Refine over time with real data.

### Q: Can I track multiple campaigns at once?
**A**: Yes! Upload a CSV with all campaigns, or use the dashboard to filter by channel/date range.

### Q: Is my marketing data private?
**A**: Yes. All calculations happen locally in your browser/server. No data is sent to external services.

### Q: How do I know which attribution model to use?
**A**: Use all 5! Each tells a different story. First-Touch for awareness, Last-Touch for conversion tactics, Linear for balanced view, Time-Decay for recency, Position-Based for industry-standard e-commerce/SaaS attribution.

### Q: What's a good CLV:CAC ratio?
**A**: 3:1 or higher is healthy for most businesses. SaaS targets 3-5:1, e-commerce 2-4:1, B2B 5-10:1.

### Q: Can I use this for B2B marketing?
**A**: Absolutely! The metrics work for any marketing (B2C, B2B, SaaS, e-commerce, local). Adjust inputs to your business model.
