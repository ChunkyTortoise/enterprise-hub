# 🧬 DNA Checklist: Skill-to-Portfolio Alignment

All agents must verify their outputs against this checklist to ensure every enhancement reinforces the user's "Elite Technical Moat."

## 1. Technical Anchors (From PORTFOLIO.md)
- [ ] **Vectorization**: Does the UI/Documentation mention NumPy-powered high-performance math?
- [ ] **Production-Grade**: Is the "301+ Automated Tests" badge prominent?
- [ ] **Institutional-Grade**: Does the visual style use "Editorial FinTech" patterns (Slate, Steel, High-Contrast)?
- [ ] **AI Integration**: Is the use of Claude 3.5 Sonnet for content generation clearly highlighted?

## 2. Market Mapping
- [ ] **SaaS Strategy**: Does the "Margin Hunter" section showcase its use in Series A pricing strategy?
- [ ] **ROI Focus**: Does the content emphasize "95% time savings" or "$24k/year savings"?

## 3. Visual Moats
- [ ] **Cinematic UX**: Are the charts interactive (Plotly) rather than static?
- [ ] **Thematic Utility**: Do the assets work in both high-light and high-dark environments?
