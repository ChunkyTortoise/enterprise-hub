**Drafts Reviewed**: [content_gen_drafts.md](file:///Users/Cave/Desktop/enterprise-hub/EnterpriseHub/docs/swarm/content_gen_drafts.md)
**Status**: REVISED & APPROVED

## Revision Notes & "Editorial FinTech" Filter

### 1. Upwork Proposal (AI Agent Architect)
- **Change**: Removed "I'm excited to help" (Generic AI tone).
- **Change**: Strengthened the link between "IBM Certification" and "Self-Correction."
- **Audit**: Verified that "LangGraph" and "RAG" match the user's `Courses.md` status (IBM RAG/Agentic AI is complete/active).

### 2. Fiverr Gig (Dashboard Surgeon)
- **Change**: Heightened the "Institutional" language. Used terms like "Dashboard Surgery" as a branded service rather than a generic task.
- **Audit**: Balanced the "Cinematic Visuals" (creative) with "NumPy Calculations" (rigor).

### 3. LinkedIn Post (Strategic AI)
- **Change**: Reformatted the hook for maximum mobile scannability.
- **Change**: Injected the specific figure "1,700+ hours" to anchor the authority.
