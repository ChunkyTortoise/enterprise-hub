## 💼 Upwork: The AI Agent Architect Proposal
**Role**: AI Solutions Architect (Enterprise RAG)

> **Subject**: IBM-Certified RAG Engineer: Deploying Self-Correcting AI Agents for [Client Business]
>
> **Body**:
> Hi [Name],
>
> Most RAG implementations fail because they lack self-correction. They hallucinate, lose context, and frustrate users.
>
> As an **IBM-Certified Generative AI Engineer** with over 1,700 hours of specialized AI/BI training, I build high-fidelity Agentic AI systems that don't just "talk"—they think and verify.
>
> **My Approach**:
> 1. **LangGraph Orchestration**: I use self-correcting loops to verify retrieval relevance before generation.
> 2. **Vector DB Optimization**: Precision indexing using the latest IBM/DeepLearning.AI techniques.
> 3. **Production-Grade Dev**: I follow strict CI/CD patterns (300+ passing tests in my own BI portfolio).
>
> **Proof of Work**: [Link to EnterpriseHub Live Demo - Agent Logic]
>
> Let's deploy an agent that actually works. When are you free for a 10-minute strategy session?
