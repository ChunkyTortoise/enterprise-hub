## 🤖 Claude CLI Prompt: The "Earning Auditor"
Copy and paste this into a new chat to evaluate your specific strengths:

```markdown
I have a production-ready repository called 'EnterpriseHub' containing:
1. Margin Hunter (Financial sensitivity modelling)
2. Market Pulse (Technical stock analysis)
3. Data Detective (AI-powered exploratory data analysis)
4. Content Engine (Claude 3.5 powered LinkedIn generator)
5. Agent Logic (News sentiment analysis)
6. Multi-Agent Workflow (Agent orchestration)

I am qualified, desperate for money ($10/hr is okay), and need a win in 12 hours.
Evaluates my code and suggest 3 specific 'Quick-Flip' services I can post on Upwork RIGHT NOW.
For each service:
- Provide a 1-sentence 'Killer Title'
- List the specific files in my repo I should use as 'Code Samples'
- Write a 2-sentence pitch for the client
- Suggest a 'Quick-Win' price point.
```

## 📈 Immediate Action Items
1. **GitHub**: Ensure your `README.md` is visible and the "300+ Tests" badge is top-and-center.
2. **Upwork**: Search for "Streamlit", "Financial Dashboard", or "Anthropic API".
3. **LinkedIn**: Post a screenshot of the `Margin Hunter` heatmap with the caption: "Stop looking at numbers. Start looking at profit scenarios. Built this 10x10 sensitivity engine today."
