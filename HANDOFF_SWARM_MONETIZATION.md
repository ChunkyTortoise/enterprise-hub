## 🛰️ 1. Current State Summary
- **Visuals**: "Cinematic UI" v4.5 active. Global themes (Light, Dark, Ocean, Sunset) standardized. Dual-font system (Space Grotesk/Inter) implemented.
- **Cleanup**: Root-level "garbage" cleared. Documentation consolidated in `docs/`. Non-production scripts archived in `_archive/`.
- **Production**: `config.toml` optimized for Streamlit Cloud. `requirements.txt` validated. 301+ unit tests passing.
- **Blockers**: Local image generation quota exhausted. (Workaround: Use "Nano Banana Pro" for asset generation).

## 🧠 2. The Swarm Strategy (Strike Team Beta)
Next session needs to activate the **Swarm Intelligence** layer in `modules/multi_agent.py`:
- **Persona 1: The Auditor**: Evaluate the current 7 modules for "Finishing School" polish.
- **Persona 2: The Strategist**: Map module capabilities to high-ticket consulting roles (Data Analyst, Quant, AI Engineer).
- **Persona 3: The Closer**: Generate specific sales copy/gigs for each "Sellable Identity".

## 💵 3. Monetization Core
- **Reference**: `docs/MONETIZATION_EXPRESS_12HR.md` contains the 12-hour "Quick Flip" roadmap.
- **The Goal**: Transition from "Project Building" to "Service Selling" immediately.
- **Assets to Leverage**: The high-end `Margin Hunter` heatmaps and `Content Engine` prompt templates.

## 🛠️ 4. Immediate Next Steps for Fresh Chat
1. **Read**: `docs/MONETIZATION_EXPRESS_12HR.md` to ground the AI in the user's financial urgency.
2. **Activate**: The "Auditor" persona to find the 3 smallest bugs that might impede a $50 sale.
3. **Draft**: 3 Upwork proposals using the "Code Samples" identified in the roadmap.
